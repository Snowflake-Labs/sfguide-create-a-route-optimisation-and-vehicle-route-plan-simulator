# Flood Risk Analysis

Welcome to the **Flood Risk Analysis** - an art of the possible geospatial risk assessment solution that helps organizations evaluate flood exposure, assess property vulnerabilities, and make informed decisions for flood risk management and mitigation.

## Overview

The Flood Risk Analysis combines historical flood data, real-time environmental monitoring, and advanced predictive modeling to provide actionable insights for flood risk assessment. This solution integrates multiple data sources including weather patterns, topographical data, and infrastructure information to deliver comprehensive flood risk evaluations.

## Key Features

### 🌊 Comprehensive Flood Risk Assessment
Analyze flood risk levels across different geographic areas using advanced hydrological modeling and historical flood data.

The flood risk assessment provides:
- **Risk zones mapping** - Visual representation of high, medium, and low flood risk areas
- **Historical flood patterns** - Analysis of past flooding events and frequency
- **Real-time monitoring** - Current weather conditions and flood warnings
- **Predictive modeling** - Forecasting potential flood scenarios based on weather patterns
- **Infrastructure impact** - Assessment of critical infrastructure exposure to flood risks

### 🏢 Building Profile and Vulnerability Analysis
Detailed analysis of individual buildings and properties to assess their specific flood risk exposure and vulnerability factors.
