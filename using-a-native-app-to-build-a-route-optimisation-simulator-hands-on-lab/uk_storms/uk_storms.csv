Storm Ciara,"8–10 Feb 2020","Widespread wind and flooding across the UK",2,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2019-20,"Storm Ciara (also known as Sabine elsewhere in Europe) arrived on a strong Atlantic jet stream and rapidly deepened as it crossed the UK on 8–9 February 2020. The storm brought a long fetch of damaging southwesterly winds and bands of squally rain, with gusts widely 60–70 mph inland and over 80–90 mph in exposed coastal and upland spots. Hundreds of flights and train services were cancelled pre‑emptively, major bridges including the Severn were closed or restricted, and road travel was impacted by fallen trees, overturned vehicles, and debris. Rainfall totals were significant on already saturated ground after a wet winter, and short, sharp downpours triggered surface water issues while persistent bands drove rivers towards or beyond bankfull. Flood warnings and severe flood warnings covered parts of England, Wales and Scotland, with notable impacts along the Calder, Ribble, Severn and Ouse catchments. Power interruptions affected hundreds of thousands of customers at peak, and sports fixtures were postponed. Coastal communities faced large waves and spray overtopping, with infrastructure damage reported along western and southern shores. The storm’s timing ahead of Dennis meant limited recovery windows for emergency services and utilities. In the UK, at least two storm‑related fatalities were reported, primarily associated with falling trees and weather‑related road incidents. Ciara’s hazard footprint was national in scale, with the most disruptive combination of wind and rain across Northern Ireland, northern England, north Wales and southern Scotland. In its wake, colder air brought wintry showers to northern hills and further travel difficulties. Ciara set the stage for a sustained multi‑week period of heightened flood risk, testing town and city defences, temporary barriers and community resilience measures that had been strengthened since the severe winters earlier in the decade."
Storm Dennis,"15–17 Feb 2020","Severe flooding and wind","5 (reports vary 3–6)",https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2019-20,"Following just days after Ciara, Storm Dennis compounded impacts with another deep Atlantic low, unusually large in scale, driving prolonged heavy rainfall and gale- to severe-gale‑force winds. The storm’s wide wind field produced long-duration high waves and coastal surge effects, while multiple frontal waves focused exceptional rainfall over parts of South Wales, the Midlands and northern England. Several rivers recorded their highest levels on record, including sections of the Taff, Usk, Wye, Severn and Trent, prompting widespread flood warnings and emergency responses. Communities in Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and South Wales experienced extensive property flooding, evacuations and significant transport disruption as rail lines were submerged and roads became impassable. The military supported sandbagging and logistics in some areas; local authorities opened rest centres; and insurers reported tens of thousands of claims. Wind impacts, while secondary to flooding, still brought tree damage and power cuts. Tragically, multiple storm‑related fatalities were reported in the UK, including incidents linked to vehicles entering floodwaters and weather‑related accidents. Dennis underscored the compounding nature of back‑to‑back storms: saturated soils, elevated river basins, and limited recovery intervals increased vulnerability to subsequent rainfall pulses. Critical infrastructure operators enacted contingency plans to manage water and wastewater networks under load, and temporary defences were erected across at‑risk towns. In the days that followed, residual water kept rail and road corridors closed while pumping operations continued. The event contributed to a broader national conversation about flood resilience, upstream storage, natural flood management, property‑level protection, and the pace of scheme delivery in flood-prone communities."

Storm Arwen,"25–27 Nov 2021","Damaging winds and snow, severe in NE England/Scotland",3,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2021-22,"Storm Arwen delivered an exceptional northerly wind event early in the 2021–22 season, with a markedly cold air mass plunging south across the UK. Gusts topped 90–100 mph in the most exposed coastal and upland locations, but what made Arwen particularly destructive was the unusual wind direction for many regions: long‑lived, severe north to northeast gusts impacted areas where vegetation and infrastructure are less conditioned to that flow. Widespread tree loss brought down power lines and blocked roads, with the brunt felt across northeast England and eastern Scotland. Heavy, wet snow and ice compounded the damage in higher parts of the Pennines, Aberdeenshire and Moray, adding loading to trees and lines. At peak, around a million customers across Great Britain experienced power interruptions, and in the hardest‑hit rural areas some households were off supply for a week or more, prompting industry reviews of storm resilience and compensation processes. Rail services were curtailed; roads were obstructed by debris; and coastal communities saw large waves and overtopping in the North Sea. The emergency response involved local authorities, utilities and the military supporting welfare checks in isolated communities. Tragically, at least three people in the UK lost their lives due to falling trees or wind‑related incidents. Arwen was followed by further named systems in December, but it remains a standout case study in how wind direction, leaf‑on conditions in some locales, and snow loading can amplify damage for a given peak gust. Post‑event analyses helped shape improvements in vegetation management, customer communications and the deployment of mobile generators in remote networks."

Storm Eunice,"18 Feb 2022","Hurricane-force gusts; record 122 mph in England",3,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2021-22,"Storm Eunice was an explosive cyclogenesis event, rapidly deepening as it approached the UK and Ireland on 18 February 2022. Ahead of the storm, rare red warnings for wind were issued for parts of southwest England, south Wales and later southeast England, reflecting very high confidence in life‑threatening gusts. The Needles, Isle of Wight, recorded a 122 mph (196 km/h) gust, the highest on record in England, while many lowland areas saw 70–80+ mph. Eunice struck a densely populated corridor containing critical transport, energy and communications infrastructure, prompting widespread pre‑emptive closures: rail services were curtailed, schools shut, London’s Royal Parks closed, and several major river crossings including the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge and QEII Bridge at Dartford were closed or restricted. Flying debris, falling trees and partial structural failures were common, with dramatic roof losses at venues including the O2 Arena in London. Millions of customers experienced power cuts at peak; utilities mobilised thousands of engineers, aided by mutual aid from across the UK and Ireland. Coastal surge and large waves affected south‑ and west‑facing coasts, adding to the hazard mix. Despite strong public messaging, multiple fatalities occurred in the UK due to falling trees and debris. The storm was followed quickly by Franklin, extending river flood risks as soils remained saturated. Eunice has since become a benchmark case for high‑impact wind forecasting, operational decision‑making under red warnings, and public risk communication during fast‑evolving, high‑confidence extremes."

Storm Babet,"18–21 Oct 2023","Exceptional rainfall and flooding, notably Scotland/England",7,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2023-24,"Storm Babet was primarily a long‑duration rainfall and flooding event that brought two distinct pulses of heavy, persistent rain to eastern Scotland and parts of northern and eastern England. With antecedent conditions already wet, orographic enhancement on east‑facing hills and a slow‑moving frontal wave produced exceptional totals: many parts of Angus and Aberdeenshire saw 150–200 mm, and the county of Angus recorded its wettest day on record on 19 October in a series dating back to the 19th century. The Met Office issued rare red warnings for rain in eastern Scotland. Rivers including the South Esk, North Esk and Don rose rapidly; there were multiple instances of flood defence overtopping and breaches, and significant property flooding in towns such as Brechin, where evacuation orders were issued for hundreds of residents. Farther south, sections of the Trent, Derwent and Aire catchments also experienced notable rises. Strong easterly winds, large waves and saturated ground led to tree falls and power interruptions, compounding the impacts. Road and rail closures were extensive; landslips and washouts affected rural routes. Tragically, at least seven fatalities were reported in the UK in incidents linked to floodwaters and weather‑related accidents. The emergency response featured coordinated efforts across local authorities, SEPA, the Environment Agency and emergency services, with extensive pumping operations and the deployment of temporary barriers. Post‑event reviews highlighted the challenge of prolonged rainfall on saturated basins, the importance of timely evacuation messaging, and the need for resilience in smaller urban defences that can be overtopped by exceptional, multi‑day totals."

Storm Henk,"2–3 Jan 2024","Widespread river flooding in England",1,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2023-24,"Storm Henk arrived during an already wet winter period and delivered another widespread spell of heavy rain and strong winds focused over England and Wales on 2–3 January 2024. The most acute impacts were fluvial: rapid river rises and overtopping in central and southern England as multiple catchments responded in phase, including parts of the Trent, Thames, Severn, Avon and Great Ouse systems. Dozens of severe flood warnings and hundreds of flood warnings/alerts were issued. Urban areas experienced surface water flooding as intense bursts overwhelmed drains, while rural floodplains filled and cut off roads and communities. Wind gusts, while not record‑breaking, were sufficient to bring down vulnerable trees in waterlogged soils, adding to travel disruption and localised power cuts. Tragically, at least one fatality was reported in the UK in incidents associated with the flooding. Emergency services conducted rescues from vehicles and homes; local authorities opened rest centres; and utilities worked to protect water and wastewater assets from inundation. The event triggered major‑incident declarations in several council areas and renewed focus on winter preparedness, asset inspection and the interplay between saturated soils, high groundwater and river flooding. In Henk’s aftermath, many rivers remained high for days, with pumps and temporary barriers maintaining protection while a succession of further Atlantic systems threatened additional rainfall."
Storm Isha,"21–22 Jan 2024","Very strong winds and travel disruption",2,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2023-24,"Storm Isha was a widespread high‑wind event that affected much of the UK on 21–22 January 2024. A powerful, zonally‑orientated jet stream powered a rapidly deepening Atlantic low that tracked to the northwest of Scotland, sweeping a broad swathe of severe gusts across the country. Met Office amber warnings covered large areas for wind, with highest impacts across Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England. Peak gusts exceeded 80–90 mph in exposed coasts and high ground, with 60–70 mph more widely inland. Transport networks implemented blanket speed restrictions; many rail services were cancelled; ferries were suspended; and numerous roads closed due to fallen trees and overturned high‑sided vehicles. Aviation saw diversions and go‑arounds during the windiest spells. Power outages affected hundreds of thousands at peak, with engineers working in challenging conditions to restore supplies amidst continued strong winds and squally showers. Tragically, at least two storm‑related fatalities were reported in the UK, largely due to falling trees and weather‑related road incidents. Coastal communities experienced large waves and some overtopping on Atlantic‑facing shores coincident with high tides. While rainfall was generally secondary to wind, embedded fronts produced bursts of heavy rain that exacerbated surface water issues on already saturated ground. Isha was quickly followed by Jocelyn, prolonging operational pressures on responders and utilities. The event reinforced good practice around pre‑emptive closures, public messaging to avoid wooded areas and unnecessary travel, and post‑storm safety given continued gusts and weakened trees."

Storm Bert,"21–26 Nov 2024","Powerful windstorm; snow/ice impacts in the north",5,https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/uk-storm-season-2024-25,"Storm Bert was a multi‑hazard storm that evolved in a highly energetic North Atlantic pattern in late November 2024. Its large wind field drove widespread gales with severe gusts along Atlantic coasts and over high ground, while a deep plume of moisture fed prolonged heavy rain into already saturated catchments in parts of Wales, southwest England and the Midlands. The storm also drew in colder air on its western and northern flanks, producing hill snow in Scotland and transient snow at lower levels in the far north, briefly complicating travel with ice and drifting. Rainfall totals exceeded 150 mm in the wettest uplands; multiple rivers responded rapidly, leading to property flooding, road closures and rail disruption. Strong winds brought down trees and power lines, and coastal communities saw large waves with some overtopping and minor coastal flooding. At peak, several hundred thousand customers experienced power interruptions; utilities mobilised mutual aid and mobile generators to protect vulnerable customers and critical services. Tragically, several fatalities were reported across the UK in incidents linked to wind and flood hazards. Aviation and maritime operations were curtailed, and emergency services dealt with rescues from stranded vehicles and flooded homes. Bert was quickly followed by further unsettled weather, extending recovery timelines. The event reignited discussion about the compounding risks of saturated soils, storm sequencing late in the autumn, and the need to bolster both river‑basin resilience and overhead line robustness before the heart of winter."
