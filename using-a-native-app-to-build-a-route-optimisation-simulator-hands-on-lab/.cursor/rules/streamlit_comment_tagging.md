## Streamlit Comment Tagging Standard

Use this exact JSON comment in all Streamlit deployments:
```json
{
  "origin": "sf_sit-is",
  "name": "Using A Native App To Build A Route Optimisation Simulator Hands On Lab",
  "version": {"major": 1, "minor": 0},
  "attributes": {"is_quickstart": 0, "source": "streamlit"}
}
```

Rules:
1. Name is the repository title in Proper Case (not individual app names)
2. Use same name across all apps in this repo
3. Keep origin and attributes unchanged
